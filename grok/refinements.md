### Refined Positioning Based on Features
Using both Solana and Züs for redundancy, plus a backend database for deduplication, gives the project unique strengths:

1. **Dual-Blockchain Redundancy**: Submitting hashes to both Solana and Züs ensures reliability—if one chain has issues, your data is still secure on the other. This is ideal for legal proofs, intellectual property, or any use case where uptime and trust matter.
2. **Smart Deduplication**: The backend database tracks previously submitted hashes. If a file’s hash has already been timestamped, users see the original record instead of resubmitting, saving time and reducing blockchain clutter.

### Updated Promotion Ideas
Leveraging these features for promotion can set the project apart:

1. **Highlight Redundancy as a Trust Factor**  
   - On the site: “Dual-blockchain redundancy with Solana and Züs—your hashes are safe, no matter what.”
   - In blogs: “What happens if one blockchain goes down? With [YourSite], your data is secure on two chains.”
   - Share in communities like r/cryptography or r/blockchain for credibility.

2. **Showcase Deduplication**  
   - Add a demo/GIF on the site: “Already timestamped? We’ll show you the original record instantly.”
   - In tutorials: Highlight time savings—“No need to resubmit; our database keeps track.”
   - For devs: Mention in API docs—“Smart deduplication means fewer transactions.”

3. **Target Specific Use Cases**  
   - Legal: Pitch to lawyers needing tamper-proof records—redundancy ensures court-ready timestamps.
   - NFT Creators: For Solana’s NFT crowd, emphasize dual-chain safety and deduplication for artwork hashes.
   - Open Source Devs: Show how deduplication saves effort for repeated code submissions.

4. **Double Down on Education**  
   - Blog post: “How Dual-Blockchain Redundancy Ensures Your File Hashes Are Always Secure.”
   - Video: Show deduplication in action—upload a file twice, display the original record.
   - Answer questions on Quora/Reddit, mentioning redundancy and deduplication as key benefits.

5. **Leverage Metrics (If Available)**  
   - Share stats: “10,000 hashes stored, 20% deduplicated.”
   - Highlight savings: “Our backend has saved X transactions on Solana and Züs.”
